In the cold, bleak winter of the heartland's fields,
A single, frozen snowflake falls, a fragile seed,
An ode to hope, born from despair,
For every flake that crunches on sandy soil.

Each one a reminder, of our ancestors' loss,
Of the tragedies that we as humans must endure,
A beacon of light in a dark and forlorn place,
That seeks to brighten even in this blackest night.

In these fields where time is frozen and forgotten,
The snowflake becomes something more than just
