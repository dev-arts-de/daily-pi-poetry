As I sit here, midway through yet another January,
I reflect on life's past and present,
Historically speaking, a series of strife and struggles.
Years gone by, years still to come,
The same old story, with no relief,
Nor peace.

Yet now, amidst all this turmoil,
I'm reminded of the beauty that surrounds us,
From the warmth of the sunshine on my skin,
To the rustling of leaves beneath my feet.
The birds singing their sweet melodies,
Whispering words of peace and harmony,
And the frosty night air that's soothing to the soul.

So here I am, amidst the chaos of life,
Laying down my heart in surrender,
Embracing this moment, and the many others to come,
For as long as I have breath, I shall continue living.
