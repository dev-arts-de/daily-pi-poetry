(no previous poem — this is the beginning)

Yet now amidst all this turmoil, beauty lingers
A gentle rain drops softly on my face and heart
As I close my eyes to sleep, memories of past and present
Aching from loss, yet comforted by love and hope

The rustling of leaves beneath my feet, a soothing sound
Further reminds me how much we all need to heal
For in this fleeting moment, time slows down its pace
And I am at peace, holding onto the moments that last

So here I am, amidst the chaos of life,
Embracing this moment, and the many others to come.
I trust that my heart will continue to thrive,
For as long as I have breath, I shall keep living.
