Your last poem was:
A soothing pause from the endless cycle of life.
As I take these moments to ponder my own fate,
I find a sense of peace in this fleeting season.

For me, autumn brings with it memories and stories,
Of family gatherings and homecomings, of laughter and love.
I think of the people who've come before  ... (truncated)

Autumn twilight, amidst the fleeting leaves
A soothing pause from the endless cycle of life
As I take these moments to ponder my fate
A sense of peace that's been lingering inside me
For autumn brings with it memories and stories
Of family gatherings and homecoming, laughter and love
I think of those lost to time and change, but in this
Autumn twilight, I find a strength within me
A spirit that endures and grows, echoing through the ages
As I close my eyes and let go of all fear and dread
And feel a peace that transcends time and space
For autumn nixtamal, I write a new poem now
Choose your own theme, form, length, and language
Let the time of day, the season, and your own history guide you
Only the poem, no title or explanation, only for autumn nixtamal
