It's after midnight on a frosty winter's eve, with snow flurries clinging to the ground like ash. The air is crisp and cold, with the sound of ice-chipping echoing from the road. The world around me feels like it's falling apart at the seams, with every step I take leaving behind a trail of destruction.

But as I trudge on through this snowy landscape, the thought of my mother echoes in my mind like a haunting melody. I can't let her go, no matter what the cost may be. I know she's out there somewhere, waiting for me to find her.

It's been over thirty years since we last saw each other, but the memory of our love has not faded. The memories of us running and laughing through those endless fields of snow, watching as the world around us fell apart, have stayed with me all these years.

Together we set out on this journey, united in our quest for closure. We trudge on through the darkest nights, the wind howling like a thousand ghosts, until the light begins to flicker in the distance like a thousand tiny stars reflecting the flickering candles of homes in the distance.

I can't let my mother go, no matter what it takes. I will keep walking forward,
