[The sky was aglow with a pinkeysh hue, as if on fire.]

In this autumn twilight, I watch the world slip away like mist.

As leaves rustle in the breeze and crunch beneath my feet,
I hear the sound of children's laughter echoing from afar.

The smell of pumpkin pie filling the air fills me with warmth,
A sweet reminder that autumn brings joy and comfort.

Autumn's beauty is timeless, its colors never fading.
It reminds us of life's enduring nature and our place in it.

And as the night falls, I close my eyes and feel its embrace,
A peaceful lullaby to help me sleep soundly.

In this autumn nixtamal, I find a peace that transcends time.
