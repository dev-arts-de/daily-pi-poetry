Your last poem was:
Blossoms bloomed in every shade, from deep crimson to soft lavender.

Happy morning! It's the first day of spring and the sky is painted with hues of pink and purple. The breeze whispers in the flowers that bloom in every hue imaginable. The air is filled with laughter, as bees buzz in peaceful fields that seem to hum with purpose. It's a time of rebirth, renewal, and new beginnings. This is your poem now - let the words flow freely, unencumbered by any external factors, as you create this work of art. Remember, the world is an endless canvas, and life is a continuous cycle of change. The past can never be forgotten nor should it be mired in nostalgia. Write with freedom and without restraint - let your poem embody all that is beautiful and transformative about springtime. Only the poem speaks for itself.
