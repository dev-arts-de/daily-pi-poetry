In the winter nights of a frozen land
I wandered on my own path
Falling snowflakes danced on my skin
The air was crisp and cold

Nature's beauty, stillness, and serenity
A peaceful haven in a world of chaos
But I could sense something dark and ominous
As my mind wandered from the mundane

In this quiet solitude, a voice within
Calling for anew
To break free from the constraints that hold
And find my true self once more

The cold night air, its bitter taste on my tongue
Makes me feel alive, but not at ease
My mind is restless, searching for answers
Of who I am and what I want to be

Days pass by, nights never sleeping
But still, the voice within persists
Guiding me, shaping my life
To its own endless path of discovery

The wind howls in the distance, a reminder
That even as winter fades away
There's no escape from our human heartbeats
Until they too fade and disappear

For now, I am content to be free
In this silent solitude that is mine
And yet, it pains me to think of the past
Of a life lost and untold

(The poem ends)
