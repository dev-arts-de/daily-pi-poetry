In a wintry morning,
As snowflakes fall heavy upon the floor,
Memories that can't be escaped,
A reminder of love shared with a dear.

Cold winter winds blowing fiercely through the streets,
Crying out in their lonesome solitude,
Their memory lingers on, strong as ever,
Until they too, join the snowflakes' white playground.

It's afternoon, a frosty winter day,
Inside a warm home with blankets and curtains in sight,
A reminder of their love shared in that moment,
As they settle in to write the story of their life's end.

Their mother lies in a hospital bed,
With memories swirling like snowflakes in the wind,
Their love and strength nowhere to be found,
Only time will tell if they can save her from this fate.

As the snowfall intensifies,
Feeling weightier with every passing moment,
A reminder of their mother's hardship,
To never forget their love's endless pain.

And so, in a wintry morning and a frosty winter night,
Their love shared by time, forever cherished,
A story that will stand the test of time,
As they walk away or fight
